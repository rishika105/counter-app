## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.

## How It Works

- The app maintains a `count` state using the `useState` hook.
- Clicking the "+" button increases the count.
- Clicking the "-" button decreases the count.
- Clicking the "reset" button sets the count back to zero.
